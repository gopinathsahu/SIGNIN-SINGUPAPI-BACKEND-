# User Authentication API with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

This repository provides a complete user authentication system with features such as signup, signin, and user management, built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The API is designed to be straightforward and easy to use for developers looking to implement user authentication in their applications.

## Key Features

- **Signup API**: Register new users.
- **Signin API**: Authenticate users and issue JWT tokens.
- **Get User Details API**: Retrieve user information.
- **Logout API**: Log the user out.
- **Forgot Password API**: Initiate password recovery.
- **Reset Password API**: Reset the userâ€™s password.

## API Endpoints

- **Signup**: `POST http://localhost:7000/api/auth/signup`
- **Signin**: `POST http://localhost:7000/api/auth/signin`
- **Get User Details**: `GET http://localhost:7000/api/auth/getuser`
- **Logout**: `POST http://localhost:7000/api/auth/logout`
- **Forgot Password**: `POST http://localhost:7000/api/auth/forgetpassword`
- **Reset Password**: `POST http://localhost:7000/api/auth/resetpassword`

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install express mongoose bcryptjs jsonwebtoken dotenv nodemailer
   ```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdbname
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

Replace `yourdbname` with the name of your MongoDB database and `your_jwt_secret` with a secret string you want to use for signing JWTs.



### Key Components

1. **app.js**: The main entry point of the application that sets up Express and connects to MongoDB.
2. **models/User.js**: Defines the MongoDB schema for user data.
3. **middleware/auth.js**: Middleware for protecting routes with JWT authentication.
4. **routes/auth.js**: Contains all the authentication-related routes and logic.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Start the Server

Run the following command to start the server:

```bash
node app.js
```

The server will run on `http://localhost:7000`.

### 2. API Endpoints

- **Signup**: Send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/signup` with JSON body containing `email` and `password`.

- **Signin**: Send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/signin` with JSON body containing `email` and `password`.

- **Get User Details**: Send a `GET` request to `/api/auth/getuser` with the JWT token included in the `Authorization` header.

- **Logout**: Send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/logout` to clear the current session.

- **Forgot Password**: Send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/forgetpassword` (logic to be implemented as needed).

- **Reset Password**: Send a `POST` request to `/api/auth/resetpassword` (logic to be implemented as needed).

## Conclusion

This user authentication API serves as a robust foundation for any application needing user registration and authentication features.
